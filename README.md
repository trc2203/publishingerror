A script written for my application to Inmarsat's Technology Development Programme 2017 as this was a mandatory part of the application.
Its purpose was to recover a situation where all the spaces in a book have been lost, and must be added back in by checking whether strings are valid English words found in the dictionary.
It did not need to account for the case where there were multiple possible valid combinations of words.

Inmarsat.py was my first, simpler, faster but more limited attempt. Inmarsatv2.py was my second, more robust but much slower attempt.
I deliberately avoided researching the problem online as I wanted to show my thought process and see if I could solve the problem independently.
It turns out that what I was trying to do would have been a lot easier if I had known about recursion at the time!
