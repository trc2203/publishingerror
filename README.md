A script written for my application to Inmarsat's Technology Development Programme.
Its purpose was to recover a situation where all the spaces in a book have been lost,
and must be added back in by checking whether strings are valid English words found in the dictionary.
It did not need to account for the case where there were multiple possible valid combinations of words.
